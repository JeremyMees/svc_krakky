Krakky is **free** and **open-source** project management software that focuses on the Kanban methodology.
Krakky is still in the very early stages and is a **work in progress**.

### Why use a kaban board

- Create a clear process and make sure tasks move through each stage.
- Then optimize your workflow to help your team work faster.
- Visual cues help team members know if a task is ready to do or already done.
